abstract: |
  This brief report summarizes a brief evaluation conducted in late 2024 of the AGU _Notebooks Now!_ project, that focused on the openness of the initiative. After 3 meetings with staff from AGU and Curvenote discussing both the vision of the initiative and the delivered materials, the conclusion I reach is that in its current state, the initiative is a solid foundation upon which to build publishing systems to include computational notebooks, with open source tools available to scientists, based on openly documented standards and approaches, and without any undue barriers to competition nor locking of key functionality behind specific vendors or proprietary services.

  I am grateful to Shelley Stahl and Brian Sedora from AGU, and Rowan Cockett from Curvenote, for their time and openness during our discussions.  All three were provided an opportunity to see my draft of this report before I finalized it, but its content and all editorial decisions remain mine.

# Scope of this audit and summary: openness for researchers, a level playing field for publishers

This document reports on my disucssions with the AGU and Curvenote teams working on the current _Notebooks Now!_ prototype infrastructure. The information here is based on discussions with Brian Sedora and Shelley Stahl from AGU, and Rowan Cockett from Curvenote. We had 3 1-hour meetings where we covered the work they have done up until now, and my goal was to answer a single question: 

> Is this work a good foundation for **open** and reproducible pipelines to publish computational notebooks content as part of the academic, peer-reviewed literature? Specifically, I looked at whether all tools and processes created or proposed would be **sufficiently open for scientists to use, build upon and modify, and for others to potentially create new efforts in this ecosystem, without any artificial barriers or lock-in that could favor a particular vendor or organization**.

In brief, my conclusion is: to the extent I was able to ascertain in this limited audit, and as per the above goal, **I found no evidence of barriers, blockage or undue favoring of any particular vendor** in the currently developed tools, documentation and plans.  While clearly AGU (and their publisher Wiley) as well as Curvenote have in-depth knowledge of the project based on their own work and participation, I didn't identify any areas where this would create artificial barriers to independent (community-driven or commercial) efforts for alternate publishing mechanisms and projects, or to the workflow of practicing scientists who seek to author and submit compatible documents.

# Context: open science and the current realities in publishing

Scientific publishing is a complex ecosystem where a mix of researchers, professional organizations, non-profit entities and commercial vendors all participate. The focus of my audit was to ascertain that we will be able to move towards a future that includes computational notebooks as part of the published record, where:

- Scientists can create notebook-based content and submit it for publication, using 100% open source tools that they can use locally or in the cloud, and that do not require support or services from any specific vendor.

- Different existing publishers can consider accepting such content by relying on openly documented standards and implementations.

- New actors can consider developing new publication models and journals based on these tools, without being at an undue disadvantage.

Importantly, this does _not_ mean that the entire end-to-end toolchain used in commercial publishing was meant to be open sourced. That was never part of the scope of the _Notebooks Now!_ effort, and I recognize that AGU, Curvenote and their partners may have developed proprietary tools as part of their publishing activities, and that these will continue to exist.

My focus was only on ensuring that **scientists could have a clean field for creating notebook-based publications wtihout any proprietary bottlenecks, and that for anyone wanting to work on the publishing side of the problem, the playing field would be open and fair**. Obviously such efforts may require publishing competitors to adapt their existing systems to these new formats or build new tools, I simply looked for any artificial barriers that would hinder such open competition in the marketplace.


# System outline

System outline for publishing. 
```

In @fig:sys-outline we see a high-level outline of the steps in the authoring and publishing workflow the Notebooks Now effort prototyped.  In this system, the following parts were developed with fully open source infrastructure and implementation:

- Submission templates for authors, as described [in the mystmd documentation](https://mystmd.org/guide/website-templates). 
- Continued standardization of the JATS/MECA for notebooks, as desrcribed in [Science Communication with Notebooks](https://curvenote.github.io/notebooks-in-publishing). This working draft was co-authored by industry and scientific community members, published under CC-BY licensing terms. It contains the authoritative reference on these ideas in a vendor- and tool-agnostic way, as it covers both the MyST and Quarto implementations and had participation of authors from both ecosystems.
  - Deployment of a website for tool specific submission instructions for the AGU template that can be contributed to by the community/working groups. [FIXME: Rowan et al - any link to this?]
  - 
  - Incorporation of publishing-specific metadata as defined by the metadata working group, also detailed in the above.
- [New MyST themes and templates were developed](https://mystmd.org/guide/website-templates), and these include specific themes for scientific articles and books. There is a [dedicated Github organization for MyST Templates](https://github.com/myst-templates), that makes it easy for the community to grow the ecosystem of available templates and improve existing ones.

Two important parts of this diagram currently remain proprietary; neither of these was in scope for my assessment, nor did I have any visibility into them:
  
- The Curvenote Submission System: this is technology developed by Curvenote that supports submissions into their systems and journals.
- Integrations with Wiley: this is part of AGU's existing publishing system, as Wiley is the publisher of AGU's current journals.

As indicated above, the existence of these proprietary components is consistent with the scope of the Notebooks Now initiative; I flag them here for completeness of this evaluation.  I hope and expect that, as part of the growing ecosystem of efforts to develop alternative models and workflows for sharing and publishing scientific content, the open parts of this initiative will both be integrated into those efforts and will spur new ideas and tools.

# Key resources and results from the _Notebooks Now!_ initiative

The following are what I consider to be the key outcomes of this effort that I specifically looked at[^1]:

- [Main _Notebooks Now!_ site](https://data.agu.org/notebooks-now): landing reference for the overall effort.

- [Science Communication with Notebooks](https://curvenote.github.io/notebooks-in-publishing): key document listed above, co-authored by industry and scientific community members, published under CC-BY licensing terms.  This is the authoritative narrative of the main publishing-oriented ideas, definitions and technology in this effort.

- [MyST Markdown site](https://mystmd.org): while MyST is a broader open source effort with its own community and goals, the _Notebooks Now!_ initiative led to many imporant improvements to MyST, and they are all documented on the core project site, ensuring the broadest reach possible.

- [Published articles showcase site](https://agu.curve.space): this site shows how a few (manually curated) real-life scientific articles from AGU disciplines look like when published with this toolchain.

- [Proceedings of the Python in Science (SciPy) Conferences](https://proceedings.scipy.org). Simlar to the above showcase, but now instead of hand-curated demonstration of AGU science, it shows the use of these tools for a real-world conference where the organizers (with Curvenote's support) adopted them to publish the complete set of proceedings. Importantly, and as a demonstration of the power and flexibility of the toolchain, the team not only used this toolchain for the [2024 proceedings](https://proceedings.scipy.org/2024), they were able to also convert the 2022 and 2023 ones to this format, as well as offer a full archive of all former abstracts dating back to 2008, that includes for each older abstract a link to the static PDF generated with previous technologies.

[^1]: The team at Posit Inc. also contributed to the authorship of some of these documents and made corresponding improvements to the Quarto toolchain; I link to it here but I did not specifically look at their architecture, nor meet with their team, as part of this evaluation.

# Conclusions and Recommendations for further work



* Peer review \- has components that are specific to industrial systems. Opportunity for AGU and others to pursue, but beyond the scope of the current capabilities.  
* Opportunity to discuss ideas about standardization of these formats for archival reasons.  
* In-depth testing of complete workflow not done yet.  
* Development still needed to nucleate and catalyze action from multiple potential actors. AGU on board, APS in discussions, neuroscience and applied mathematics possibleâ¦   
* Suggest **working groups** on peer review, standards \+ archiving.
